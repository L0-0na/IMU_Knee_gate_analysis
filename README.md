# üìå Project Summary

This project focuses on the acquisition and processing of signals from two inertial measurement units (IMUs) to study the behavior of the knee and hip during walking. The primary objective was to model and mitigate measurement noise to enable accurate tracking of joint angles in gait analysis.

Key components include:

- Theoretical study of human gait cycle, IMU technologies (accelerometers, gyroscopes), and error modeling.

- Design and implementation of a mechanical platform (robotic arm with 2 degrees of freedom) simulating lower limb motion.

- Development of an electronic system (MPU-6050 sensors, ATmega2560 microcontroller, Bluetooth communication) for signal acquisition and wireless data transmission.

- Creation of a software interface to visualize data online and facilitate real-time monitoring.

- Statistical analysis and noise modeling using Allan variance, enabling classification of sensor errors and validation of sensor reliability for angle estimation.

- Final gait tracking experiments confirming the system‚Äôs ability to monitor knee and hip motion accurately during walking.
